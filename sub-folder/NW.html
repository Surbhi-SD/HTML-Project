        <h2>1. The Northern Lights: Aurora Borealis</h2>
        <p>The Northern Lights have become a sensation for tourists traveling in the Northern Hemisphere. The Northern Lights are auroras, or naturally occurring phenomena that consist of mystifying displays of light in the sky. The northern lights dance across the sky and emanate a diffused glow along the northern horizon.
The intensity of northern lights increases as you head north towards the magnetic pole in the Arctic. Unfortunately, the northern lights appear only randomly, making it a challenge for travelers to see while on a short trip. They are more often experienced by locals who live in these northern regions. Some of the most popular places to see northern lights are in Canada's far north, Alaska, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.</p>

    <h2>2. The Grand Canyon</h2>
    You only need to stand on the rim of the Grand Canyon once to know why it's one of the 7 natural wonders of the natural world. The Grand Canyon's massive and colorful landscape provides breathtaking views that can't be found anywhere else in the world.
Most visitors head to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and spend a full day admiring the views from the overlooks that stretch along the top of the canyon. If you are in good shape and want to have a more immersive experience, head down into the canyon on one of the numerous hiking trails. For something a little less strenuous, take a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon for an unforgettable lifetime experience.
If you are interested in the formation and geology of the canyon, stop in at the Geological Museum to learn about what you are seeing. From Lipan Point along Desert View Drive, you can get a great view of the rock layers in the canyon wall.
The Grand Canyon is located in Arizona, USA. The closest major cities are Las Vegas and Phoenix.

<p><h2>3. Paricutin</h2>
    Even avid travelers may not know about Paricutin, mainly because this natural wonder resides in Michoac√°n, Mexico. This cinder cone volcano was named one of the 7 natural wonders of the world, even over famous volcanoes, such as Yellowstone.
Paricutin last erupted in 1952. It was coined one of the natural wonders of the world because mankind witnessed its birth and rapidly growing formation. You can venture on a twelve-mile round-trip to the peak of the volcano, either by hiking or horseback. Hikers will walk through sandy banks and lava fields surrounding the volcano.</p>
